**Code used for the paper titled _Automated Image Stitching on Ultrasonic C-scan Thickness Data_ **
by _Alexandru Nichita, Yifeng Zhang, and Frederic Cegla_
in the _Non-Destructive Evaluation_ group in the _Department of Mechanical Engineering_ at _Imperial College London_


The two main files used are _main_simulation_ for the results obtained by analysing the simualted data set and _main_lab_data_ which was used on the lab data set.
The _Common_Functions_ folder contains the common methods used in the main files. Mostly for code cleanup. 

The 1200 simulated depth maps are in the _DatabaseCombined_ folder.
The lab depth maps are the _Steel_Database_material_number.mat_ files. 

Results presented in the figures in the paper come from the data in the _Results_ folder.
